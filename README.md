Determining mild algebraic insights in the relation between constants A and B in the elliptic curve


Utilising basic algebra to determine the relation already existent in a given elliptic curve on the basis that some or all of its portions are rational.

> When the solutions of the have or include zero in them i.e (0,0), that's a pickle.
